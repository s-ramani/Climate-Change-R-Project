# Climate-Change-R-Project
In this project I have:

used charts and summary measures to discuss the extent of climate change and its possible causes
used line charts to describe the behaviour of real-world variables over time (Part 1.1)
summarized data in a frequency tables, and visualized distributions with column charts (Part 1.2)
described a distribution using mean and variance (Part 1.2)
used scatterplots and the correlation coefficient to assess the degree of association between two variables (Part 1.3)
explained what correlation measures and the limitations of correlation (Part 1.3).
